Further information and usage statistics can be found at [Mozzila](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/todotxt-extension/).

# Usage

The extension requires the following options:

1. Location of your Todo.txt file
2. Location of your Done.txt file

After this configuration it is possible to see every finished and incomplete tasks and add, delete or modify them accordingly. 

## Syntax

The extension can automatically assign the appropriate properties to a Thunderbird task based on the Todo.txt syntax. This means that when a user enters a new Task with Todo.txt syntax it will result in a correct Thunderbird task.

For example:
`(A) foobar +Dev +Home @PR`

Entered as a new task within Thunderbird, it will automatically have the following properties:
* High priority
* Categories set to *DEV* & *Home*
* Title containing *foobar*
* Location set to *@PR*

Offcourse the Todo.txt file will contain the exact line as entered into Thunderbird including a creation date.
